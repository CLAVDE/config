yuki.cfg
========
high-fps competitive csgo config

yuki.cfg contains commands
userconfig.cfg contains binds

some commands are useless without the binds and viceversa, and some binds need to be changed in both yuki.cfg and userconfig.cfg if you are going to change them.

everything should be easily modifiable as it is well organized. "preference_commands" and "crosshair_commands" are likely what you would be most interested in checking out, together with binds of course.

Installation
============
put launch commands into launchcommands, if you do not how to do this, ignore it.

put the files here;

Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg

when using config for first time be sure to write "exec yuki" in console. viewmodel settings might reset occasionally, fix this by execing yuki in console again.
