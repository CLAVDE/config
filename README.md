yuki.cfg
========
high-fps competitive csgo config

yuki.cfg contains commands
userconfig.cfg contains binds

some commands are useless without the binds and viceversa.
everything should be easily modifiable as it is well organized. "preference_commands" and "crosshair_commands" are likely what you would be most interested in checking out, together with binds of course.

Installation
============
put files into. put launch commands into launchcommands, if you do not how to do this, ignore it.
